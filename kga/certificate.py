"""kga.certificate -- finite-sample certificates Delta_hat +/- epsilon for KGA.

A *certificate* answers the question "by how much does adapting beat freezing,
and how sure are we?".  Concretely it carries

    Delta_hat   estimated benefit  Delta = R(f0) - R(fa)  (>0 means adapt helps),
    epsilon     a confidence radius at level ``alpha``,

Feeding the certificate to :func:`kga.policy.decide` yields the
ADAPT/FREEZE/ABSTAIN trichotomy with the false-adapt ``<= alpha`` guarantee of
Theorem 3.

Sidedness of the radius (read this before quoting an interval)
--------------------------------------------------------------
:func:`empirical_bernstein` and :func:`hoeffding` return **one-sided** radii:
each satisfies, separately,

    Pr[ Delta >= Delta_hat - epsilon ] >= 1 - alpha        (lower side)
    Pr[ Delta <= Delta_hat + epsilon ] >= 1 - alpha        (upper side)

but *not* both simultaneously at ``1 - alpha``.  By a union bound the two-sided
event ``|Delta - Delta_hat| <= epsilon`` holds only at ``1 - 2 alpha``.  This is
exactly what the trichotomy needs and no more: the ADAPT branch only ever uses
the lower side and the FREEZE branch only ever uses the upper side, so
``FA_u <= alpha`` and ``FF_u <= alpha`` each follow from a *single* one-sided
statement.  Any figure, table or sentence that presents ``[lower, upper]`` as a
simultaneous interval must label it ``1 - 2 alpha``.  (Panel finding F2-12 /
F1-12; the companion fix restates ``thm:certificate`` as two one-sided coverage
conditions rather than one two-sided one.)

:func:`conformal_split` is the exception: its radius is a two-sided
order statistic of ``|Delta_hat - Delta|``, so ``Pr[|Delta - Delta_hat| <=
epsilon] >= 1 - alpha`` holds simultaneously for that estimator.

This module provides four estimators, each mirroring a piece of the paper's
canonical code:

* :func:`empirical_bernstein` -- Maurer & Pontil (2009) empirical-Bernstein LCB,
  the batch Theorem 3 certificate, identical to
  ``vendored_from_elara/certification/switching_certificate.py::
  empirical_bernstein_lcb`` and ``kbound_pkg/kbound/certificate.py``.
* :func:`hoeffding` -- the distribution-free Hoeffding LCB (looser baseline).
* :func:`conformal_split` -- the exact split-conformal order-statistic radius
  over ``|Delta_hat - Delta|`` calibration residuals, the
  cross-task estimator used in ``knowability_experiment.py`` /
  ``mixed_regime_experiment.py``.
* :func:`evalue_anytime` -- the anytime-valid testing-by-betting e-process
  (Ville's inequality), Theorem 3b, mirroring
  ``experiments/kbound/theory_validation/val_thm3_evalue.py`` and
  ``kbound_pkg/kbound/eprocess.py``.

All estimators are pure ``numpy``/``math``, deterministic, and torch-free.

Provenance / attribution
------------------------
The empirical-Bernstein switching certificate (:func:`empirical_bernstein`,
Maurer & Pontil 2009) is **shared with the companion ELARA work**: the identical
Maurer-Pontil lower-confidence-bound underlies ELARA's Phase-2
``switching_certificate``, which now *delegates* to this ``kga`` implementation as
the single source of truth.  It is reproduced in the K-Bound tree so the package
is fully self-contained, and the shared lineage is acknowledged openly rather than
hidden.  K-Bound imports nothing from ``src/elara``.

    For i.i.d. paired benefits ``X_i = loss(f0_i) - loss(fa_i)`` in ``[a, b]``
    with empirical mean ``mu_hat`` and unbiased sample variance ``V_hat``, with

                       - 7 R ln(2/alpha) / ( 3 (n - 1) ),     R = b - a.

    The estimate is ``delta_hat = mu_hat`` and the radius is the sum of the two
    subtracted terms, so ``delta_hat - epsilon`` reproduces the LCB above.  This
    is tighter than Hoeffding whenever ``V_hat << R^2`` (the usual regime, where
    most paired benefits agree in sign), and is deterministic, streamable, and
    finite-sample valid.

    The radius is **one-sided at ``alpha``** (note the ``ln(2/alpha)``: the 2 pays
    for the union of the variance and range deviations *within* one side, not for
    two sides).  ``[lower, upper]`` is therefore a ``1 - 2 alpha`` interval; see

        requires ``R`` to be known before seeing the data; substituting the
        observed ``max - min`` (which this function used to do by default) makes
        the range term data-dependent and under-estimates ``R``, so the stated
        ``1 - alpha`` guarantee no longer holds.  There is no safe default, so
        there is no default: for ``|p - y|`` paired 0/1 losses pass ``2.0``.

    """Split-conformal certificate around a benefit point estimate.

    Given calibration residuals ``r_i = |Delta_hat_i - Delta_i|`` from held-out
    tasks/instances -- the query instance's own residual **must not** be in the
    pool -- the radius

        k = ceil((n + 1) * (1 - alpha))

    guarantees that a fresh ``Delta_hat`` deviates from the true ``Delta`` by at
    most ``epsilon`` with probability at least ``1 - alpha`` over the exchangeable
    calibration split (split-conformal coverage). The returned radius is an
    observed residual order statistic; it does not use interpolated quantiles.
    Because it bounds ``|Delta_hat - Delta|``, this is the one *genuinely
    two-sided* estimator in the module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    delta_hat : float
        Point estimate of the benefit for the query instance (e.g. from a
        leave-one-out / cross-fitted benefit regressor).
    calib_residuals : array-like of shape (n,)
        Absolute prediction errors ``|Delta_hat_i - Delta_i|`` on the
        calibration set.  Must be non-negative and must exclude the query.
    alpha : float, default=0.1
        Miscoverage level.
    on_infeasible : {'inf', 'raise'}, default='inf'
        Behaviour when ``n < min_calibration_size(alpha)``; see
        :func:`split_conformal_rank_radius`.  There is no clamp mode.

    Returns
    -------
    Certificate
        With ``method='conformal'`` and ``n`` = number of calibration residuals.
        ``epsilon`` is ``+inf`` (hence ABSTAIN) when ``n`` is too small.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np

    """Anytime-valid e-value certificate (Theorem 3b, testing-by-betting).

    Runs the two one-sided betting e-processes of
    ``val_thm3_evalue.py`` over the supplied benefit stream::

        E_t^+ = prod_{i<=t} (1 + lam_i  X_i)       tests H0 : Delta <= 0,
        E_t^- = prod_{i<=t} (1 + nu_i (-X_i))      tests H0': Delta >= 0,

    with predictable truncated-aGRAPA bets ``lam_i = clip(mu_hat/sigma2_hat, 0,
    bet_cap_frac/|a|)`` (and symmetrically ``nu_i``).  Each process is a
    nonnegative supermartingale under its null, so by **Ville's inequality**
    ``P(exists t : E_t >= 1/alpha) <= alpha`` -- simultaneously over all sample
    sizes, with no multiplicity correction for repeated looks.

    The returned certificate encodes the *current* anytime decision in the same
    ``delta_hat +/- epsilon`` form consumed by :func:`kga.policy.decide`:

    * if ``E_t^+ >= 1/alpha`` (reject ``Delta <= 0``) we emit a positive
      certified lower bound, so ``decide`` returns ADAPT;
    * if ``E_t^- >= 1/alpha`` (reject ``Delta >= 0``) we emit a negative
      certified upper bound, so ``decide`` returns FREEZE;
    * otherwise the radius covers the running mean and ``decide`` ABSTAINs,
      i.e. "keep sampling".

    ``delta_hat`` is the running sample mean of the benefits (a consistent point
    estimate of ``Delta``); only the *sign of the certified bound* carries the
    anytime guarantee.

    Parameters
    ----------
    paired_benefits : array-like of shape (n,)
        Ordered stream of per-sample benefits ``X_i`` in ``[a, b]``. Values
        outside the predeclared support raise; they are never silently clipped.
    alpha : float, default=0.1
        Anytime type-I error budget.
    a, b : float, default=-1.0, 1.0
        Lower/upper bounds of the benefit range.  ``a`` must be ``< 0`` and
        ``b`` must be ``> 0`` for the two one-sided tests to be well posed.
    bet_cap_frac : float, default=0.5
        Bet cap: ``lam in [0, bet_cap_frac/|a|]``; ``< 1`` guarantees the wealth
        factors stay strictly positive.
    prior_var, prior_weight : float
        Prior pseudo-variance and pseudo-count for the running second moment.

    Returns
    -------
    Certificate
        With ``method='evalue'`` and ``n`` = stream length.
