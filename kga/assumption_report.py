"""Stable import path for the assumption-report schema.

The definitions live in :mod:`kga.assumptions` alongside the diagnostics that
populate them; this module only re-exports them, so reporting tools can depend on a
name that will not move if the diagnostics are reorganised.

Importing this pulls in numpy/scipy via :mod:`kga.assumptions`.  Tools that only
need to *read* emitted reports should read the JSON directly -- the schema is fixed
and documented in the paper (Table: assumption-report schema).
