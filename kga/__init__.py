"""kga -- Knowability-Guided Adaptation (KGA), the K-Bound decision algorithm.

KGA can decide without deployment target labels after a benefit estimator has
been fitted on labelled development conditions and its residual radius calibrated
on a disjoint split.  Deployment maps label-free evidence ``Z`` to a certificate
``Delta_hat +/- epsilon`` and applies the trichotomy

    ADAPT   if Delta_hat - epsilon > 0
    FREEZE  if Delta_hat + epsilon < 0
    ABSTAIN otherwise

with false-adapt probability bounded by ``alpha`` conditional on the stated
coverage/transfer assumptions (Theorem 3 of the K-Bound paper).

Controlled-grid replay rule
---------------------------
The controlled-grid re-scoring path routes through
:func:`kga.policy.decide_kga`. That function pins the degrees of freedom that
used to vary between copy-pasted historical scripts:

* the radius is the **exact split-conformal rank** quantile
  ``eps = r_(k)``, ``k = ceil((n + 1)(1 - alpha))`` -- never an interpolated
  ``np.quantile``, and ``+inf`` (forced ABSTAIN) when ``k > n``;
* the pool is **leave-one-out-of-pool**: cell ``i``'s radius excludes its own
  labelled residual;
* the trichotomy uses **strict** inequalities, matching the ``|M| > beta``
  commitment convention of the knowability frontier.

Public API
----------
KGA                        -- facade gate (evidence -> frozen estimator -> decide).
BenefitEstimator           -- protocol for a frozen benefit model.
FrozenLinearBenefitEstimator -- auditable reference estimator artifact.
Decision                   -- the ADAPT/FREEZE/ABSTAIN enum.
Certificate                -- a finite-sample certificate ``Delta_hat +/- eps``.
Evidence                   -- the label-free evidence ``Z`` container.
decide_kga                 -- the canonical end-to-end rule (see above).
decide_batch               -- vectorised trichotomy over stored arrays.
split_conformal_rank_radius / conformal_radii_loo / min_calibration_size
                           -- the radius primitives.

The submodules ``kga.certificate`` and ``kga.policy`` remain the stable import
surface for scripts; nothing there has been renamed.

The core decision path is ``numpy``/``scipy`` (no torch) and deterministic.
