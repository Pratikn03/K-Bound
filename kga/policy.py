"""kga.policy -- Trichotomy with conditional certificate-based error control.

The Knowability-Guided Adaptation (KGA) gate turns a finite-sample certificate
``Delta_hat +/- epsilon`` into one of three actions:

* ``ADAPT``   -- the certified lower bound is strictly positive,
                 ``Delta_hat - epsilon > 0``;
* ``FREEZE``  -- the certified upper bound is strictly negative,
                 ``Delta_hat + epsilon < 0``;
* ``ABSTAIN`` -- the certificate representation does not support a strict
                 commitment. This may reflect finite sample size, estimator
                 error, transfer failure, or structural ambiguity.

This is the maintained public KGA rule. Historical experiment artifacts retain
their own declared protocols; this implementation does not retroactively alter
their calibration designs or validate their statistical assumptions.

Conditional certificate criterion.
    Let ``B`` be the certificate's declared scalar target. If its lower bound
    satisfies ``P(B >= delta_hat - epsilon) >= 1 - alpha`` under the stated
    sampling/calibration/transfer assumptions, then ADAPT implies ``B > 0`` on
    that coverage event. Consequently

        P( ADAPT  and  B <= 0 )  <=  alpha.

    The symmetric statement requires a valid upper bound for that same target.
    Coverage for a measured cell does not, by itself, cover population benefit.
    These are unconditional joint error-event bounds, not bounds conditional
    on commitment or a claim of simultaneous two-sided coverage for every
    certificate method.

    The specified ``evalue_anytime`` e-process instead controls directional
    rejection over time for its fixed declared nulls and bounded stream, with
    predictable bets. Ville's argument does not authorize arbitrary repeated
    deployment decisions, candidate changes, or an adaptively changed testing
    setup. Its common certificate container is not a confidence interval.

The threshold function cannot verify the target, coverage, or transfer
assumptions. Its conditional guarantee is inherited from a valid certificate,
not created by choosing a numerical radius.

Which function should I call?
-----------------------------
* :func:`decide`      -- one :class:`~kga.certificate.Certificate` -> one
  :class:`Decision`.  The primitive.
* :func:`decide_batch` -- vectorised :func:`decide` over arrays of
  ``delta_hat`` / ``epsilon`` (``epsilon`` may be scalar or per-cell).
* :func:`decide_kga`  -- the historical controlled-grid replay compatibility
  rule: stored per-cell benefit estimates and realised benefits in, decisions
  out, with a leave-one-out-of-pool exact-rank residual radius. The canonical
  refitted controlled-grid path is :func:`kga.crossfit.controlled_grid_crossfit`.
  The seven
  copy-pasted ``decide_kga`` forks that produced the published numbers used an
  interpolated ``np.quantile`` over a pool that included the scored cell, and
  they are gone.

Tie-breaking
------------
Every comparison is **strict**, and this is deliberate: it is the same
convention as the knowability frontier, where a cell is committed only when
``|M| > beta`` and ``|M| == beta`` is unknowable
(``experiments/kbound/theory_validation/val_frontier.py:67,72``;
``val_benefit_frontier.py:50`` takes the ``abs(M) <= beta`` branch as
"unknowable").  So a certificate whose lower bound is exactly zero ABSTAINs, and
a certificate with ``epsilon = +inf`` (the small-``n`` infeasible conformal case)
always ABSTAINs.

def decide(certificate: Certificate, alpha: float | None = None) -> Decision:
    """Apply the K-Bound trichotomy to a finite-sample certificate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    certificate : Certificate
        A certificate carrying ``delta_hat`` (estimated benefit of adapting over
        freezing) and ``epsilon`` (the one-sided/symmetric confidence radius at
        level ``certificate.alpha``).
    alpha : float, optional
        If given, asserts that the certificate was computed at this level.  The
        decision rule itself does not re-use ``alpha`` (the guarantee is baked
        into ``epsilon``); this argument exists only to make the operating level
        explicit at the call site and to catch accidental mismatches.

    Returns
    -------
    Decision
        ``Decision.ADAPT``  if ``delta_hat - epsilon > 0``,
        ``Decision.FREEZE`` if ``delta_hat + epsilon < 0``,
        ``Decision.ABSTAIN`` otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``epsilon`` is negative or NaN, if ``delta_hat`` is nonfinite,
        if the level or sample count is invalid, or if ``alpha`` is supplied
        and disagrees with ``certificate.alpha``. A ``+inf`` radius represents
        an unavailable finite certificate and returns ABSTAIN.

    Notes
    -----
    Boundaries are decided with *strict* inequalities, so a certificate whose
    lower bound is exactly zero (``delta_hat == epsilon``) ABSTAINs rather than
    ADAPTs.  This is the conservative choice and matches the reference scripts.

    """Historical controlled-grid replay: stored ``b_hat``/``B`` in, decisions out.

    New controlled-grid results must use
    :func:`kga.crossfit.controlled_grid_crossfit`, which refits from ``Z`` and
    ``B`` with the scored outcome absent from both estimator fitting and
    residual calibration.  This compatibility function implements exactly one
    stored-prediction radius rule.  It has one switch, ``calibration``, and
    that switch is **not** a statistical option: its non-default value replays an
    archived pre-fix artifact and is forbidden for a new number (see below).
    There is no clamp mode and no interpolated mode, at any setting:

    1. **Radius** -- the exact split-conformal *rank* quantile
       ``eps = r_(k)``, ``k = ceil((n + 1)(1 - alpha))``, over the absolute
       residuals ``r_i = |delta_hat_i - benefit_i|``
       (:func:`kga.certificate.split_conformal_rank_radius`).  Interpolated
       ``np.quantile`` is never used.  When ``k > n`` the radius is ``+inf``
       and every cell ABSTAINs (fix-queue item 25).
    2. **Pool** -- cell ``i``'s radius is calibrated on the *other* ``n - 1``
       residuals only (:func:`kga.certificate.conformal_radii_loo`), removing
       direct self-inclusion (fix-queue item 4). This does not prove residual
       exchangeability across correlated or heterogeneous conditions.
    3. **Trichotomy** -- ADAPT iff ``delta_hat_i - eps_i > 0``; FREEZE iff
       ``delta_hat_i + eps_i < 0``; otherwise ABSTAIN.  Strict inequalities, so
       a lower bound of exactly zero ABSTAINs, matching the ``|M| > beta``
       commitment rule of the knowability frontier.

    The certificate criterion applies conditionally: if the interval has the stated
    marginal coverage, ADAPT implies positive benefit on the coverage event.
    The leave-one-condition-out grid construction itself is an empirical
    calibration design, not a proof of exact split-conformal coverage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    delta_hat : array-like of shape (n,)
        Per-cell benefit point estimates, e.g. the leave-one-cell-out
        gradient-boosted ``b_hat`` stored in the per-condition dumps.
    benefit : array-like of shape (n,)
        The realised per-cell benefits ``B_i = acc(f_a) - acc(f_0)`` used to form
        calibration residuals.  Used for the radius only, never for the decision.
    alpha : float, default=0.1
        Miscoverage level.
    calibration : {'loo', 'in_pool'}, default='loo'
        ``'loo'`` is the rule.  ``'in_pool'`` reproduces the archived, leaky
        pre-fix radius (one radius over all ``n`` residuals, including the scored
        cell's own) and exists only so a historical artifact can be replayed;
        it must not be used for a new number.  It changes the *pool*, never the
        rank rule.

    There is deliberately no ``on_infeasible`` argument.  When the calibration
    pool is too small for ``alpha`` (``k > n``, i.e. ``n <= 8`` at
    ``alpha = 0.10``; under ``'loo'`` that means ``n <= 9`` cells) the radius is
    ``+inf``, a :class:`UserWarning` is emitted, and every cell ABSTAINs.  The
    superseded clamped radius is not reachable from here at any setting.

    Returns
    -------
    (epsilon, decisions) : (numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray)
        ``epsilon`` has one radius **per cell** (it is not a scalar under
        ``'loo'``); ``decisions`` are ``'ADAPT'``/``'FREEZE'``/``'ABSTAIN'``
        strings.  A caller that needs one number for a table must report
        ``float(np.mean(epsilon))`` and label it a mean.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the two arrays differ in length, or ``calibration`` is unknown.
